The Movement DAO multisignature wallet ("Movement Multisig") is a Gnosis Safe at ms.movedao.eth (mainnet:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6). The Movement Multisig is responsible for custody of Movement DAO's treasury and the execution of onchain Movement Multisig actions described in Movement DAO governance proposals.

Movement Multisig Safe Owners ("Multisig members") must agree to abide by the following principles:

1. Multisig members agree to act in accordance with the will of Movement DAO, as expressed through the Movement DAO governance process.
2. The Movement Multisig must maintain a Safe threshold equal to or greater than 60 percent of the number of Multisig members.
3. All Movement Multisig transactions must be in accordance with the Movement DAO governance process.

Multisig members in violation of these principles are to be removed from the Movement Multisig.
