## About

Some DAOs can have legal wrappers. This section describes the types of treasuries which would benefit, so you can make the decision for yourself.

Each treasury supported by Juicebox should fall into a legal framework regardless of the project owner’s intention to develop off-chain structures. Certain disclaimers should be provided during the treasury definition citing optional materials available and a signal from the project owner should be available for 3rd parties via the treasury interface. The following are guidelines and proposals for such information to be made available via the interface and the documentation. Throughout the following materials and examples the term Treasury was used as the “entity”, feel free to search and replace this with your application or further define, i.e. Juicebox’s treasury application.
