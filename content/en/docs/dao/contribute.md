# Movement DAO Contributor Guidelines

Movement DAO strives towards an open contribution model. Contributors do not need to present a resum√©, application, or any identifying information to begin contributing. Movement DAO asks that contributors consider the following process before becoming a paid contributor.

New contributors should also reach out to active contributors on Discord to figure out where the DAO needs help, or to propose new objectives.
