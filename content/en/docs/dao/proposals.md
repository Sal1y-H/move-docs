## Writing a Proposal

Use the [proposal template](../template) as a starting point. When writing your proposal, try to be as detailed as possible in your specification. Plan with potential risks, failures, and backups in mind. Only include what is necessary—governance cycles often have twenty or more proposals, and unnecessarily long proposals increase the burden on all participants.

## Community Feedback

When your draft is ready, create a proposal discussion thread in the `#✍️｜proposal-workshop` channel of the [Movement DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz). Use community feedback to finalize your proposal.

## Submitting Your Proposal

Once your proposal is finalized, head to the [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) to submit it as a basic voting proposal. If you are not comfortable with this step, tag a contributor for help.

Once your proposal is in the Temperature Check Space, share a link in the proposal's discussion thread. From here, your proposal will follow the [governance process](../governance).
