## Getting Started

New contributors are advised to introduce themselves in the [Movement DAO Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz/), and to familiarize themselves with areas they would like to contribute to. New contributors should also reach out to active contributors on Discord to figure out where the DAO needs help, or to propose new objectives. Project coordination typically takes place in Movement DAO's [Notion workspace](https://www.notion.so/movedao/).

## Trial Payouts

Contributors who have completed some work and familiarized themselves with the DAO's ongoing efforts are encouraged to propose a one-time trial payout. These proposals should detail work which has already been completed and plans for upcoming contributions to the DAO. Read [How to Make a Governance Proposal](proposals.md) to learn more.

## Recurring Payouts

Contributors who have completed one or more trial payouts are advised to propose an ongoing role and payout for themselves if desired. This proposal should detail responsibilities, task-based objectives, and long-term goals. Sunset clauses are strongly encouraged.

## Next Steps

1. Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz/).
2. Read recent Discord messages and [governance proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth) to familiarize yourself with high level ongoing projects.
3. Reach out to active contributors in channels related to areas you would like to contribute to. Ask what you can help with or propose new objectives for the DAO.
4. Participate in the DAO for 1-2 weeks before proposing a payout.
