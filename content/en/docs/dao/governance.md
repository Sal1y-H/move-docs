# Movement DAO Governance Process

Movement DAO is governed by its community, as expressed through token voting.

## Phase 0: Ideation

Proposal authors are encouraged to create a discussion thread in the [Movement DAO Discord Server](https://discord.gg/movexyz) to workshop proposals. See [How to Create a Proposal](/) for best practices.

## Phase 1: Proposal Space

Once finalized, authors can submit their proposals to Movement DAO's [Proposal Space](/). As the legal custodian of Movement DAO, dao-lawfirm.eth maintains the right to revoke proposals which endanger the Movement Endowment during this stage. After 45 days, proposals in this stage will be archived.

## Phase 2: Consensus

Every 14 days, proposals with at least 20 "For" votes in the [Proposal Space](/) are moved to Movement DAO's [Consensus Space](/) as basic single choice votes which last seven day

## Phase 3: Execution

Proposals with more than 66% "For" votes are queued for execution by the Movement Multisig. "Abstain" votes are not included in this calculation.

## Emergency Governance

In an emergency scenario, the Movement Multisig can take onchain actions if explicit public approval from 80 percent or more of Multisig members and explicit public approval from dao-lawfirm.eth is received.
